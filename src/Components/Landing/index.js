        <h2>The Path to Successful Childhood Education Starts Here</h2>
        <p>Welcome to Milestones Academy Childcare Center, an environment of active exploration and discovery for children ages 18 months – 6 years. We are excited and proud to open our new location in the Orange County region, offering preschool
          and pre-kindergarten programs for families located in Lake Forest, Laguna Hills, Mission Viejo, Foothill Ranch, and the surrounding areas. Milestones is founded on the philosophy that children, their families, and society benefit from
          high quality, early childhood education programs. We believe that there is an indisputable link between a child’s early enrichment and success later in life. We believe that teachers are resources, problem posers, and partners in learning.
          Explorative materials, language building activities, hands-on-science, social studies, dramatic play, and artistic expression enrich a child’s life experience.</p>
